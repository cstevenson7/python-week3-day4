    "\n",
    "#### What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time and space complexity is the measure of how much time a given action(function) will take to solve a problem. In the same fashion, we determine how much a given data structure will need in terms of memory allocation. A problem can have multiple solutions and finding the optimal solution for the problem needs to be analyzed in time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we measure Time and Space Complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to measure time and space complexity we use Asymptotic analysis. The reason for this is because we need a way to measure different algorithms (functions) based on the size of their inputs in a mathmatical way. For example, we could have a function that is computed as f(n) and another that is g(n^2). All things around the function staying constant, the only thing that changes is the size of the input. Below is the chart that shows the different Asymptotic analysis formats. "
